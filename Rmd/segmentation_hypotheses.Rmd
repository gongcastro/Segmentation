We tested whether infants recognised familiar words at test, what may indicate that the HPP adaptation we are using is suitable to our aims. Previous studies reported that eight-month-old infants are able to success at this task [@bosch2013; @jusczyk1995; @nazzi2005; @polka2012]. We expected all infants to recognise familiar words at test. This should be evidenced by a preference toward either the familiar or the novel words. This preference should be reflected in different looking times test items. This was a control experiment in which we are tested whether infants, regardless of their linguistic profile (monolingual or bilingual) were able to segment made-up words from natural speech in their native language. For this reason, we did not split our sample according to linguistic profile, profile as we would have done in subsequent experiments.

**Operational hypothesis**: Looking times to familiar and novel words will differ at
0.05 significance criterion, measured by a paired *t*-test.
