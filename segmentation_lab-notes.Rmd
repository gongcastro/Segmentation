# Introduction

We used an adaptation of @jusczyk1995's Head-turn Preference Procedure to investigate how 8 months-old infants react when listening a familiar word when one phoneme has been changed. In the familiarisation phase, infants listened for 2 minutes to several sentences in their dominant language (either Catalan or Spanish). The sentences embedded a made-up word (*gon*, *mus*, *for*, or *pul*). Half of the infants listened to sentences embedding *gon* and *mus*, whereas the other half listened to sentences embedding for and pul. In the test phase, all infants listened to the four words in isolation. Two of them were familiar, two of them were unfamiliar. At the beginning of each trial of the test phase, a rotating pinwheel was displayed in the central screen to grab the infant’s attention. Once the infant fixated the pinwheel, the pinwheel disappeared from the central screen and appeared randomly in either the right or the left screen. Once the infant fixated at the side pinwheel, one of the four words was played repeatedly with 0.5 seconds interval between repetitions until the infant looked away for more than 2 seconds. At this point, the pinwheel disappeared and the word stopped being played, finishing the trial. In each trial, the experimenter coded on-line how long the infant looked to the pinwheel while the word was being played. We compared infants’ looking time in trials in which a familiar word was played and in trials in which an unfamiliar word was played. Differences in looking time towards familiar vs. unfamiliar words would suggest that infants recognised familiar words. 

Familiar words were presented in the test phase exactly as they were presented in the familiarisation phase. We will also compare monolinguals vs. bilinguals, while controlling the potential effect effect of the randomisation infants were allocated in (infants familiarised with *gon* and *mus* vs. infants familiarised with *for* and *pul*). Our hypothesis is that both monolinguals and bilinguals will look different times to familiar and unfamiliar words, independently of the randomisation.

**Hypothesis**: Looking times to familiar vs. unfamiliar words will be different, regardless of linguistic profile (monolinguals vs. bilinguals) and randomization (*gon*-*mus* vs. *for*-*pul*).

# Methods
 
## Participants

We collected data from `r n` participants, distributed across the different conditions (`Language profile`, `Dominant/native Language`, `Randomisation`) as follows:

```{r sample_size, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

n.cell <- data.agg %>%
  group_by(condition, language) %>%
  count(condition, language) %>%
  spread(language, n)

kable(n.cell, digits = 2, align = "c", col.names = c("Randomisation", "Catalan", "Spanish"), caption = "Sample size across condition, Randomisation = words presented in the familiarisation phase.")

```

### Demographic variables

* Infants were recruited from private clinics one ore two days after birth.
* Socio-economic status (SES) was assessed via a short questionnaire.

```{r sample_demo_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
n.demo <-
  data.agg %>%
  select(participant, language, mother_education, father_education) %>%
  group_by(participant, language, mother_education, father_education) %>%
  summarise() %>%
  group_by(language, mother_education, father_education) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  gather("parent", "education", -language, -n) %>%
  mutate(parent = sub("_education", "", parent))

kable(n.demo %>%
        group_by(language, parent, education) %>% summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
        spread(education, n), digits = 2, align = "c", col.names = c("Language", "Parent", "Baccalaureate", "University", "Vocational"))
```

### Age

The accepted age range for collecting participants was from 7;15 to 9 months (261-280 days).

```{r demo_age, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data.agg, aes(x = age, fill = language)) +
  geom_density(colour = NA, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(x = "Age (days)", y = "Density", fill = "Testing language")+
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_line(linetype = "dotted", colour= "grey"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    legend.position = "top",
    text = element_text(colour = "black", size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(colour = "black")
  )
```

### Linguistic profile

* Linguistic profile was assessed sing the Language Exposure Questionnaire [@bosch2001].
* Catalan and Spanish monolinguals (minimun exposure of `r min.mon`% to Catalan or Spanish) and Catalan-Spanish bilinguals (maximun exposure of `r max.bil` to Catalan or Spanish). In the pilot study, infants will be recruited regardless of their linguistic profile.
* Catalan accents other than that from Barcelona were excluding criteria, as well as Spanish Andalusian and Latin American accents.
* Both Catalan and Spanish-dominant infants were included in the monolingual and bilingual groups.

## Stimuli

We created four target words: *gon*, *mus*, *for*, and *pul*, involving the Catalan/Spanish contrast /o-u/. None of those words exist in Spanish^[The word *mus* actually exists. It is a card game. However, infants are extremely unlikely to be familiar with this word.]. Infants have been shown to start segmenting words starting with consonants earlier than words starting with vowels [@mattys2001].

We created six different sentences for each target word. The position of the target word within the sentences was counterbalanced so every passage grouped sentences containing the target words at the initial (2), middle (2) and final (2) positions.

### Stimuli recording and editing

For each word we created 7 different passages combining the same 6 sentences, separated by 1 second. Within each passage, the order of the sentences was randomised using a randomizer [link](www.random.org). The sentences were concatenated in random order with one constraint: the last sentence of one passage should not be the same as the first of the next passage, to avoid the same sentence to be repeated consecutively. The order of the resulting passages was the same in both languages. The passages were presented in the same order to all infants in the same condition.

Recordings were made using Audacity software (version 2.0.5; @audacity^[Audacity® software is copyright © 1999-2018 Audacity Team Web site: https://audacityteam.org/. It is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The name Audacity® is a registered trademark of Dominic Mazzoni.]  as `.wav` files, and edited using Praat [version 6.0.37; @praat].

The edition pipeline for the passages consisted in the following steps: 1) Sentences were recorded by a proficient Spanish/Catalan bilingual female talker. The same talker recorded all stimuli in a single session. The talker was asked to read the stimuli while not emphasizing the target non-words. The recordings were made in a sound attenuated room with a multi-pattern condenser microphone. Online monitoring ensured good sound quality recording. 2) Silences at the onset and the offset of each recording were removed. 3) Peak intensity intensity for each passage was normalised at 65.0 dB. 4) Silences of 1000 ms duration were added at the offset of each recording. 5) Passages of sentences were concatenated. 6) Passages of each condition were concatenated. This step resulted in four different strings: a GONMUS string in Catalan, a GONMUS string in Spanish, a FORPUL string in Catalan, and a FORPUL string in Spanish. Within each condition, all infants listened to the same string.

The edition pipeline for the **test words** consisted on the following steps: 1) Words were recorded individually exactly as sentences were recorde, by the same speaker, in the same session. 2) Silences at the onset and the offset of each recording were removed. 3) The intensity for each passage was set at 65.0 dB. The spaces between words in the test phase was introduced by the script used to display stimuli during the experiment.

## Procedure

* Presentation and instructions for the parents.
* We used the HeadTurn preference procedure (HPP) as in @jusczyk1995.
    - Familiarisation phase: infants will be exposed to passages of sentences containing target words.
    - Test phase: infants will listen to consecutive repetitions of 4 isolated words which can either be familiar or unfamiliar.
* All sessions were visually recorded for further analysis.
* Online MATLAB coding with WISP script was used.

### Familiarisation phase

* For each word, a passage of 6 sentences embedding it was created. 
* Infants were familiarised with passages corresponding to two of the words. Hence, infants listened to two passages, what means that each infant listened to 12 different sentences, 6 embedding one word, 6 embedding the other word.
* The duration of each passage was similar. All infants listened to the sentences for 2 minutes. The duration of familiarisation was set according to @bosch2003.
* During the first minute of familiarisation, infants listened to both passages of sentences (each embedding a target word) while moving clouds were displayed in the central screen.
* To control any intrinsic preference toward any of the words (which may potential bias looking preferences in the test phase), we counterbalanced the familiarisation words. Half of the infants were familiarised with the words *gon* and *mus* (condition GONMUS), whereas the other half was familliarised with the words *for* and *pul* (condition FORPUL).

### Training phase

During the second minute of familiarisation, infants listened agains both passages of sentences. This time, a blinking light was displayed in the central screen. When the infant fixated the blinking light, the light disappeared from the central screen and started being displayed in either the right or the left screen randomily. When the infant fixated the blinking light in the side screen at least once and stopped looking at it for at least 2 seconds, the light returned to the central screen. The aim of this minute of familiasiation is that the infants get familiar with both the side screens.

### Test phase

In the test phase, 12 trials were performed (3 for each of the 4 words). Three blocks of 12 trials were prepared. Words were separated by 2 seconds and repeated continuously in each trial until maximum of 18 seconds in each trials (7 repetitions max.).

Each trial of the test phase consisted of repetitions of the same word. Words within the same trial were separated by 1500 seconds as in @bosch2013.

Each trial started with the display of a visual stimulus in the central screen. When the infant looked at it, the stimulus disappeared and another one appeared in one of the side screens. A list of a random word was played from the loudspeaker in the same side. Listening time of each trial was registered. Orientation time towards the side in which stimuli were displayed was considered as listening time (a head-turn of 30º or more degrees).

For the completion of the complete trial, a minimum of 2 seconds of looking time was set. If visual orientation towards the screen was interrupted, recording time was paused and resumed once visual contact was re-established. After 2 seconds of ceased visual orientation, trial was stopped, considered null and a new trial began.
No predictions were made about the direction of preference towards the familiar or unfamiliar stimuli.

A paired *t*-test comparing novel vs. familiar looking times failed to reject the null hypothesis at 0.05 significant criterion, *t*(`r abs(round(tost$df, 2))`) = `r abs(round(tost$t, 2))`, *p* = `r abs(round(tost$p, 3))`, Cohen's *d* = `r abs(round(tost$df, 2))`. A visual inspection of the data revealed that such a lack of statistically significant differences was unlikely to be due to the looking pattern of infants tested in a specific language. Given that this test does not provide any evidence supporting the null hypothesis, we opted to follow-up this analysis with equivalance testing. We performed two one-sided paired *t*-tests, contrasting our *t* estimate against those those corresponding to the lower and upper threshold of the smallest effect size we are interested in detecting with our design. We defined such effect size as a Cohen's *d* of 0.5. We based our decission in the most similar previous study we could find: @bosch2013 tested word segmentation from natural speech using a similar procedure in Catalan and Spanish monolinguals and bilinguals. They found such effect sizes when comparing familiar and novel looking times in all groups: *d* = 0.41 for Spanish monolinguals, *d* =  0.48 for Catalan monolinguals, and *d* = 0.51 for Catalan-Spanish bilinguals. To perform this test, we used the TOSTER R package @lakens2017. We achieved a statistical power of `r round(power, 3)` in each constrast. Results are summarised below:

```{r tost, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
